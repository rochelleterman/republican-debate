" Im Jake Tapper. Were live at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California for the main event. Round 2 of CNNs presidential debate starts now.",TAPPER
" The eleven leading Republican candidates for president are at their podiums. They are ready to face off, and if youve been watching this race, you know anything could happen over the next few hours.",TAPPER
" To viewers who are just joining us, welcome to the Air Force One Pavilion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Our thanks to the staff here and especially to former first lady Nancy Reagan for this impressive setting with Ronald Reagans presidential plane as our backdrop.",TAPPER
" This debate is airing on CNN networks in the United States and around the world. Its also being broadcast on the Salem Radio Network. I know everyone is very eager to get started. But first, I want to explain the ground rules tonight. My name is Jake Tapper. Ill be the moderator. I will be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt. He worked in the Reagan administration for six years. And by CNNs chief political correspondent Dana Bash. I will ask follow-up questions, I will attempt to guide the discussion. Candidates, I will try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. Youll have one minute to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. Ill give you time to respond if youve been singled out for criticism. Our viewers should know we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. These 11 Republicans are positioned on the stage based on their ranking in recent national polls.",TAPPER
" Our goal for this evening is a debate. A true debate, with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ. Where they disagree  on policy, on politics, on leadership. Now, lets begin. Id like to invite each candidate to take 30 seconds to introduce him or herself to our audience. First to you, Senator Paul.",TAPPER
" Good evening, everyone. Im an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky. My wife, Kelly, and I have been married for nearly 25 years, and I spend my days defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I think theres nothing more important than understanding that the Constitution restrains government, not the people. Thank you.",PAUL
" Im Mike Huckabee. Im delighted to be on this stage with some remarkable fellow Republicans. None of us are a self-professed socialist. None of us on this state are under investigation by the FBI because we destroyed government records, or because we leaked secrets. I know that there are some in the Wall-Street-to-Washington axis of power who speak of all of us contemptuously. But Im here to say that I think we are, in fact, the A team. We have some remarkable people, and, in fact, not only are we the A team; we even have our own Mr. T, who doesnt mind saying about others, youre a fool. And Im delighted to be here with all of these guys, and would put any of them in an administration that I led. Thank you very much.",HUCKABEE
" Thank you. My name is Marco Rubio. Im from Florida. My wife Jeanette and I are the proud  weve been married 17 years, and were the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening. Im honored to be here at the Reagan Library, at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service, but also our love for country. And Im also aware that California has a drought, and so thats why I made sure I brought my own water. (LAUGHTER)",RUBIO
 Senator Cruz?,TAPPER
" Im Ted Cruz. I am the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom. Im a husband to my best friend, Heidi, whos here tonight. Im a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life, Caroline and Catherine. If youre fed up with Washington, if youre looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties, Im the only one on this stage who has done that over and over again, and if we stand together, we can bring America back.",CRUZ
" Hi, Im Ben Carson, and Im a retired pediatric neurosurgeon. Im here with my wife, Candy, of 40 years, and two of my sons, and their wives. I stress the pediatric part of my career because the reason that Ive gotten involved in this race is because Im very concerned about the future of our children, and the direction of our country is one that does not portend well, unless we, the people, intervene and retake our rightful place at the pinnacle.",CARSON
" And I just want to be  make it clear that Im grateful to be here with all of you again, and welcome the addition of Carly Fiorina, as well.",CARSON
" Im Donald Trump. I wrote The Art of the Deal. I say not in a braggadocious way, Ive made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again. We build our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life altogether. Thank you. Thank you.",TRUMP
" Im Jeb Bush, and I believe Americas on the verge of its greatest century, and Im ready to lead. Im a committed, conservative reformer that cut taxes, that balanced budgets, that took on the special interest in Florida, and we won. I look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken Washington D.C., and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country. Thank you.",BUSH
" Good evening, Im Scott Walker, and tonight, I want to thank and Mrs. Reagan, and the Reagan Library for hosting us. You see, in my lifetime, the greatest president was a governor from California. Ronald Reagan knew how to go big, and go bold. He understood the essence of moving this country forward, and thats what I did when I took on the status quo in my state, and the Washington based special interest. Now, more than ever, America needs a leader who will go big and bold again. Someone whos been tested. Im ready to be that leader. Thank you.",WALKER
" Good evening. My story, from secretary to CEO, is only possible in this nation, and proves that everyone of us has potential. My husband, Frank, of 30 years, started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop. We have come to a pivotal point in our nations history where this nations possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it. I am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation.",FIORINA
" Hello, Im John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio. Emma, and Reese, my children, and Karen, love ya girls. Thanks for watching tonight. By the way, I think I actually flew on this plane with Ronald Reagan when I was a congressman, and his goals, and mine, really much  are pretty much the same. Lift Americans, unify, give hope, grow America, and restore it is to that great, shining city on a hill. Yes, he was a great one, and I learned much from watching him. The most important thing, hope to Americans, unify, lift everyone in America.",KASICH
" Hi, my name is Chris Christie, and Id like to you take the camera off me and put it on the audience because Id like to ask all of you, how many of you, raise your hand, believe that in todays Barak Obama America your children will have a better life than youve had? You see? Thats why Im running for President. because leadership is not about me, its about our country. And, what we talk about tonight, its not about us, its about the people in the audience tonight, because in seven short years this president has stripped away their trust, and their faith, and their belief that the next generation will have a better life. Hes stolen that from us, and when Im president, Im going to take it back.",CHRISTIE
" Thank you one and all for being here. There are many important policy issues facing our nation. Were going to get to many of them tonight, but I do want to start off with some current events in the news, and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail.",TAPPER
" Mrs. Fiorina, I want to start with you. Fellow Republican candidate, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, has suggested that your partys frontrunner, Mr. Donald Trump, would be dangerous as President. He said he wouldnt want, quote, such a hot head with his finger on the nuclear codes. You, as well, have raised concerns about Mr. Trumps temperament. Youve dismissed him as an entertainer. Would you feel comfortable with Donald trumps finger on the nuclear codes?",TAPPER
" You know, I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer. Hes been terrific at that business. I also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability, judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure. All of us will be revealed over time and under pressure. I look forward to a long race.",FIORINA
 You didnt answer my question. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trumps finger on the nuclear codes? Its an issue that one of your fellow candidates has raised.,TAPPER
" Thats not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer, and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America.",FIORINA
 Mr. Trump?,TAPPER
" Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldnt even be on this stage. Hes number 11, hes got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, theres far too many people anyway. As far as temperament  and we all know that  as far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament. I built a phenomenal business with incredible, iconic assets, one of the really truly great real-estate businesses. And I may be an entertainer, because Ive had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place, with The Apprentice and everything else Ive done. But I will tell you this: What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman, and thats the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back, because we owe $19 trillion right now, $19 trillion, and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back. And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now.",TRUMP
" Mr.  Senator Paul, your name has been invoked.",TAPPER
" I kind of have to laugh when I think of, Mmm, sounds like a non sequitur. He was asked whether or not he would be capable and it would be in good hands to be in charge of the nuclear weapons, and all of a sudden, theres a sideways attack at me. I think that really goes to really the judgment. Do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin? Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran? I think really theres a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. Im very concerned about him  having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his  his visceral response to attack people on their appearance  short, tall, fat, ugly  my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?",PAUL
 Mr. Trump?,TAPPER
" I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, theres plenty of subject matter right there. (LAUGHTER) That I can tell you.",TRUMP
" But Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake",WALKER
 I want to  I want to give Mr. Trump,TAPPER
" But Jake, this  this is  this",WALKER
"  Mr. Trump, I want to give you another chance  Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond to something that your rival to your left, Governor Bush, said. Governor Bush told me last week when I read him the quote from Governor Jindal that he agrees youre not a serious candidate. Tell Governor Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander-in-chief. TRUMP: Ive actually been in politics all my life, although Ive been on that side as opposed to this side. Im now a politician for about three months. Obviously, Im doing pretty well. Im number one in every polls (sic) by a lot. But the qualification is that Ive dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. Everything Ive done virtually has been a tremendous success. When markets changed, when things turned, I heard Governor Pataki, who, by the way, was a failed governor in New York, a very seriously failed  he wouldnt be elected dog catcher right now. I heard what he had to say. And I will tell you this: Atlantic City, Ive made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago, Ive gotten great credit for my timing, and thats what Im all about. Im a businessman, did really well, really well, and Jeb, what I want to do is put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that, and Im not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that.",TAPPER
" Governor Bush, would you feel comfortable with Donald Trumps finger on the nuclear codes?",TAPPER
" I think the voters will make that determination. But what I know to be true is that the next president of the United States is going to have to fix an extraordinary difficult situation. This administration, with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, has created insecurity the likes of which we never wouldve imagined. Theres not a place in the world where were better off today than six and a half years ago. And that requires a steadiness. That requires an understanding of how the world works. That requires an understanding and appreciation of American leadership in the world. You cant just, you know, talk about this stuff and insult leaders around the world and expect a good result. You have to do this with a steady hand, and I believe I have those skills. WALKER Jake, this is  this is  this is",BUSH
" But I have to say WALKER This is actually whats wrong  this is whats wrong with this debate. Were not talking about real issues. And Mr. Trump, we dont need an apprentice in the White House. We dont need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now. He told us all the things we wanted to hear back in 2008. We dont know who you are or where youre going. We need someone who can actually get the job done. And you talked about business.",TRUMP
" Well, in Wisconsin WALKER You  you  let me finish",TRUMP
" Excuse me. WALKER No, no",TRUMP
" In Wisconsin, youre losing $2.2 billion right now. WALKER Youre using the talking",TRUMP
" I would do so much better than that. WALKER Mr. Trump, youre using the talking points of the Democrats",TRUMP
 No. WALKER  and as we all know,TRUMP
" Im using facts. WALKER  that failed three times in four and a half years when I got elected, because it is working. We balanced a budget. You want to talk about balanced budgets? You took four major projects into bankruptcy over and over and over again. You cant take America into bankruptcy. Thats whats wrong with the politicians in Washington right now. They think we can take a country into bankruptcy. (CROSSTALK)",TRUMP
" Every major business leader has used the  I never went bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows. But we  hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, Ive used",TRUMP
" Thank you, Dr. Carson.",TAPPER
" See, Jake, it wasnt me. (LAUGHTER)",CHRISTIE
" Jake, Ill tell you  Ill tell you why people are supporting outsiders. Its because you know what happens if someones been in the system their whole life, they dont know how broken the system is. A fish swims in water, it doesnt know its water. Its not that politicians are bad people, its that theyve been in that system forever. The truth is 75 percent of the American people think the government is corrupt; 82 percent of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases, 25 years in other cases. The borders been insecure for 25 years; 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care. These things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo. You know what a leader does? They challenge the status quo, they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results. That is what my whole life has been about. People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R ",FIORINA
 Thank you.,TAPPER
  this is about changing the system.,FIORINA
" Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. Governor Bush, in addition to the fact that hes an outsider, one of the reasons Mr. Trump is a frontrunner, Republican voters say, is because they like the fact that he is not bought and paid for by wealthy donors. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the $100 million youve raised for your campaign makes you a puppet for your donors. Are you?",TAPPER
" No. Absolutely not. People are supporting me because I have a proven record of conservative leadership where I cut taxes $19 billion over eight years. We shrunk the state government workforce, we created a climate that led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating. People know that we need principle-centered leadership, a disrupter to go to Washington, D.C. The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something  that was generous and gave me money  was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida ",BUSH
 I didnt ,TRUMP
 Yes you did.,BUSH
 Totally false.,TRUMP
 You wanted it and you didnt get it because I was opposed to ,BUSH
 I would have gotten it.,TRUMP
  casino gambling before ,BUSH
 I promise I would have gotten it.,TRUMP
 during and after. And thats not  Im not going to be bought by anybody.,BUSH
" I promise if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.",TRUMP
 No way. Believe me.,BUSH
 I know my people.,TRUMP
 Not even possible.,BUSH
 I know my people.,TRUMP
 Is there anything else you want to say about this?,TAPPER
" No. I just will tell you that, you know, Jeb made the statement. Im not only referring to him. I  a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here. And the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people. Im spending all of my money, Im not spending  Im not getting any  I turned down  I turn down so much, I could have right now from special interests and donors, I could have double and triple what hes got. Ive turned it down. I turned down last week $5 million from somebody. So I will tell you I understand the game, Ive been on the other side all of my life. And they have a lot of control over our politicians. And I dont say that favorably, and Im not sure if theres another system, but I say this. I am not accepting any money from anybody. Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country. Im going to do the right thing.",TRUMP
" Governor  BUSH: Youve got, according to your  to what you said on one of the talk shows, you got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding ",TAPPER
 Thats true. Thats true.,TRUMP
  because you gave her money. Maybe it works for Hillary Clinton ,BUSH
" I was  excuse me, Jeb.",TRUMP
  it doesnt work for anybody on this  on stage.,BUSH
" I was a businessman, I got along with Clinton, I got along with everybody. That was my job, to get along with people.",TRUMP
 But the simple fact is ,BUSH
 I didnt want to  excuse me. One second.,TRUMP
" No. The simple fact is, Donald, you could not take ",BUSH
" OK, more energy tonight. I like that. (LAUGHTER) Look ",TRUMP
 I was asked the question.,BUSH
" I didnt want  it was my obligation as a businessman to my family, to my company, to my employees, to get along with all politicians. I get along with all of them, and I did a damn good job in doing it. Go ahead.",TRUMP
" So he supports Pelosi, he supports Schumer, he supports Clinton ",BUSH
 Got along with everybody.,TRUMP
" When he  and he  when he asked  when he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no.",BUSH
 Wrong.,TRUMP
 We said no. And thats the simple fact. The simple fact is ,BUSH
" Dont make things up. Jeb, dont make things up. Come on.",TRUMP
 Dont cut me off.,BUSH
 Dont make things up.,TRUMP
" Jake, can I say something about that?",CARSON
 Sure Dr. Carson.,TAPPER
" You know, when I entered this race, all the political pundits said its impossible; you cant do it because youre not connected with the money. And theres no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully. I in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires. I have said to the people if they want me to do this, please get involved. And we now have over 500,000 donations, and the money is coming in. But the pundits forgot about one thing, and that is the people. And they are really in charge.",CARSON
" Thank you, Dr. Carson. Lets move to Russia if we could. Russia is sending troops and tanks into Syria right now to prop up a U.S. enemy, Bashar al-Assad. President Obamas incoming top general says, quote, Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security. Mr. Trump, you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin, you say you will get along, quote, very well. What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria?",TAPPER
" So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero. Syrias a mess. You look at whats going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: were fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe  and I may be wrong, in which case Id probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. We dont get along with China. We dont get along with the heads of Mexico. We dont get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and every other way. We get along with nobody. I will get along  I think  with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable  stable world.",TRUMP
" So, you  just to clarify, the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would  you would reach out to Vladimir Putin, and you would do what? You would",TAPPER
" I believe that I will get along  we will do  between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems, we wont have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations. TAPPER: Senator Rubio, youve taken a very different approach to the  the question of Russia. Youve called Vladimir Putin a, quote, gangster. Why would President Rubios approach be more effective than President Trumps?",TRUMP
" Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and its pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force. He himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union  the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and now hes trying to reverse that. Hes trying to destroy NATO. And this is what this is a part of. He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East. Heres what youre gonna see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly  fly combat missions in that region, not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad. He will also, then, turn to other countries in the region and say, America is no longer a reliable ally, Egypt. America is no longer a reliable ally, Saudi Arabia. Begin to rely on us. What he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East, and this president is allowing it. That is what is happening in the Middle East. Thats whats happening with Russia, and",RUBIO
" Thank you, Senator Rubio. (CROSSTALK)",TAPPER
 I want to bring in Carly Fiorina.,TAPPER
 Having,FIORINA
" Ms. Fiorina, you have met",TAPPER
" Having met Vladimir Putin, if I may",FIORINA
" yeah, youve met Vladimir Putin. Yes.",TAPPER
" Having met Vladimir Putin, I wouldnt talk to him at all. Weve talked way too much to him. What I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. Id probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimanis name is because Russia is in Syria right now, because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad. Russia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control. We could rebuild the Sixth Fleet. I will. We havent. We could rebuild the missile defense program. We havent. I will. We could also, to Senator Rubios point, give the Egyptians what theyve asked for, which is intelligence. We could give the Jordanians what theyve asked for",FIORINA
" Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.",TAPPER
 bombs and materiel. We have not supplied it,FIORINA
 Thank you.,TAPPER
 I will. We could arm the Kurds. Theyve been asking us for three years. All of this is within our control.,FIORINA
" Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. While youre  while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran, the next president, no matter who he or she may be, will inherit President Obamas Iran deal. Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one, as you have promised to do, is, quote, inexperienced, and, quote, playing to a crowd. Respond to Governor Kasich, please.",TAPPER
" Well, let me tell you, Jake, the single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran. Weve seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative, and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic. This deal, on its face, will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, making the Obama administration the worlds leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.",CRUZ
" This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran, and this deal will only accelerate Irans acquiring nuclear weapons. Youd better believe it. If I am elected president, on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.",CRUZ
" Why is that not, as Governor Kasich says, playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced?",TAPPER
" Well, lets be clear when it comes to experience. What President Obama wants to do is hes run to the United Nations, and he wants to use the United Nations to bind the United States, and take away our sovereignty. Well, I spent five and a half years as a Solicitor General of Texas, the lead lawyer for the state, in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I went in front of the Supreme Court, and took on the world court of the United Nations in a case called Medellin v. Texas, and we won a historic victory saying the World Court, and the U.N., has no power to bind the United States, and no President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, has the authority to give away our sovereignty. And, so, if theres anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran, theyre giving up the core responsibility of commander in chief, and as president, I would never do that.",CRUZ
 Governor Kasich,TAPPER
" Yeah, well",KASICH
 Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd?,TAPPER
" Well, let me just say this. First of all, I think its a bad agreement, I would never have done it. But, you know, a lot of our problems in the world today is that we dont have the relationship with our allies. If we want to go everywhere alone, we will not have the strength as (ph) if we could rebuild with our allies. Now, this agreement, we dont know whats going to happen in 18 months. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. Ive seen lots of issues in foreign affairs, and foreign  in terms of global politics, you have to be steady. Now, heres the  if they cheat, we slap the sanctions back on. If they help Hamas, and Hezbollah, we slap the sanctions back on. And, if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon, than the military option is on the table. We are stronger when we work with the Western civilization, our friends in Europe, and just doing it on our own I dont think is the right policy.",KASICH
" Thank you, Governor. I want to go to Senator Paul. TRUMP(?): Slow (ph) and steady, (inaudible) chicken",TAPPER
" I want to go to Senator Paul. Senator Paul, the White House is rolling out the red carpet next week for the President of China, President Xi. Governor Walker says that President Obama should cancel the state dinner because of Chinas currency manipulation, and because of Chinas alleged cyber attacks against the United States. Is Governor Walker right?",TAPPER
" I think this goes back to essentially what weve been saying for the last two or three questions. Carly Fiorina also said were not going to talk with Putin. Well, think if Reagan had said that during the Cold War? We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now. Should we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. Should we cut up the agreement immediately? Thats absurd. Wouldnt you want to know if they complied? Now, Im going to vote against the agreement because I dont think theres significant leverage, but it doesnt mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement, and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not Iran has complied. The same goes with China. I dont think we need to be rash, I dont think we need to be reckless, and I think need to leave lines of communication open. Often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world, or disengaged in the world, and I think this is an example of some who want to isolate us, actually, and not be engaged. We do need to be engaged with Russia. It doesnt mean we give them a free pass, or China a free pass, but, to be engaged, to continue to talk. We did throughout the Cold War, and it would be a big mistake not to do it here.",PAUL
" Governor Walker, Senator Paul seemed to suggest",TAPPER
" that canceling the state dinner would be rash, and reckless.",TAPPER
" Two parts to that, one on China, one back for a second on Iran. When it comes to China, why would we be giving an official state visit to a country thats been involved in a massive cyber attack against the United States? Thats not just a visit, thats a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House. It just doesnt make any sense. If were ever going to send a message to them, wouldnt this be the time, when theyve issued this, sort of, massive attack against us? And, Jake, for the question, I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one. The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know, the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up. The reality is its a bad deal on day one, and its a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer, and closer. Id love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran. We need a leader whos going to stand up, and actually (INAUDIBLE)",WALKER
 Jake,FIORINA
 Governor Bush CRUZ(?): Jake,TAPPER
" Governor Bush, your father was the chief diplomatic envoy to China back when Nixon opened relations to China. Is Scott Walkers approach the right one, canceling the state dinner?",TAPPER
" No, I dont think so, but we need to be strong against China. We should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security, send a deterrent signal to China. There should be super sanctions in what President Obama has proposed. Theres many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner. Thats not going to change anything, but we can be much stronger as it relates to that. As it relates to Iran, its not a strategy to tear up an agreement. A strategy would be how do we confront Iran? And, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration. And, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israels back.",BUSH
" If we do that, its going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of.",BUSH
 I want to turn,TAPPER

"  however you want, but I want to ask this question.",TAPPER
" Ive been patiently waiting, and Im going to just say this about Iran.",HUCKABEE
" All right, sir, go ahead.",TAPPER
" Because I think it is incredibly important. This is really about the survival of Western civilization. This is not just a little conflict with a Middle Eastern country that weve just now given over $100 billion to, the equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion. This threatens Israel immediately, this threatens the entire Middle East, but it threatens the United States of America. And we cant treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power. This is a government for 36 years has killed Americans, they kidnapped Americans, they have maimed Americans. They have sponsored terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and they threaten the very essence of Western civilization. To give them this agreement, that the president treats like the Magna Carta, but Iranians treat it like its toilet paper, and we must, simply, make it very clear that the next president, one of us on this stage, will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place.",HUCKABEE
" OK. (UNKNOWN): Jake, Id like to",TAPPER
" Were going to turn now to Hugh Hewitt, from Salem Radio Network.",TAPPER
" Thank you, Jake. Mr. Trump, two years ago, President Obama drew a red line that the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad crossed, President Obama threatened to strike. He did not, his knees buckled. We now have 4 million refugees, Syria is a living hell, and he turned to the Congress for the authority to back him up. You have three senators to your right that said, no. Do they bear responsibility for this refugee crisis, and what would you have done when Bashar Assad crossed the line?",HEWITT
" I wouldnt have drawn the line, but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility, but I think he probably didnt do it, not for that reason. Somehow, he just doesnt have courage. There is something missing from our president. Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force, done something to Assad  if he had gone in with tremendous force, you wouldnt have millions of people displaced all over the world.",TRUMP
" How much responsibility, Mr. Trump, do the senators hold?",HEWITT
" They had a responsibility, absolutely. I think we have three of them here",TRUMP
 Senator Rubio,HEWITT
" I think they had a responsibility, yes.",TRUMP
" Let me tell you  I will tell you we have zero responsibility, because lets remember what the president said. He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks. If the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. And were not going to authorize use of force if youre not put in a position where they can win. And quite frankly, people dont trust this president as commander-in-chief because of that.",RUBIO
" Senator Paul? PAUL: I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldnt. Had we bombed Assad at the time, like President Obama wanted, and like Hillary Clinton wanted and many Republicans wanted, I think ISIS would be in Damascus today. I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad. Sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe. This is real debate we have to have in the Middle East. Every time we have toppled a secular dictator, we have gotten chaos, the rise of radical Islam, and were more at risk. So, I think we need to think before we act, and know most interventions, if not a lot of them in the Middle East, have actually backfired on us.",HEWITT
" Thank you, Senator Paul. I want to turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.",TAPPER
" Hold on, a second, Jake, he asked me, as well. Id like to actually",RUBIO
" That would be fair, youre right. Youre the third senator.",TAPPER
"  respond. I think Im the first senator. (LAUGHTER) The No. 1 test for use of military force should be the vital national security interest of the United States. The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria, is because he couldnt answer the question what do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra, like Al Qaida, like ISIS? Now, I also want to respond to several folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal, see if the Iranians will comply. Anyone who is paying attention to what Khamenei says knows that they will not comply. There is a reason Khamenei refers to Israel as the little Satan, and America as the great Satan.",RUBIO
" In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khamenei led the assembled masses in chanting, death to America. Im reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khamenei saying, Death to all Americans, and then it shows John Kerry coming back, saying, Can we meet ya half way? (LAUGHTER) We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country. And Ill tell you, I cant wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.

Secondly, nobodys trusting Iran. They violate the deal, we put on the sanctions, and we have the high moral ground to talk to our allies in Europe to get them to go with us. If they dont go with us, we slap the sanctions on anyway. If they fund these radical groups that threaten Israel and all of the West, then we should rip up the deal and put the sanctions back on. And let me make it clear  let me make it clear (CROSSTALK)",KASICH

We wont know under this agreement  there are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off limit all together. Beyond that, the other facilities, we give them 24 days notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence. And most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever. And let me know  President Obama is violating federal law",CRUZ

  turn back to Governor Huckabee,TAPPER
 Jake?,FIORINA
" I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee. Governor Huckabee, last week, you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as I dont need to tell you. Youve called what happened to Kim Davis, that clerk, an example of the criminalization of Christianity. There are several people on the stage who disagree with you. Governor Bush, for example, says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law. Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity? HUCKABEE: No, I dont think hes on the wrong side of such an issue. Jeb is a friend. Im not up here to fight with Jeb or to fight with anybody else. But I am here to fight for somebody who is a county clerk elected under the Kentucky constitution that 75 percent of the people of that state had voted for that said that marriage was between a man and a woman. The Supreme Court in a very, very divided decision decided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage. Its a decision that the other justices in dissent said they didnt have and there wasnt a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do it. I thought that everybody here passed ninth-grade civics. The courts cannot legislate. Thats what Roberts said. But heck, its what we learned in civics. The courts cant make a law. They can interpret one. They can review one. They cant implement it. They cant force it. But heres what happened: Because the courts just decided that something was going to be and people relinquished it and the other two branches of government sat by silently  I thought we had three branches of government, they were all equal to each other, we have separation of powers, and we have checks and balances. If the court can just make a decision and we just all surrender to it, we have what Jefferson said was judicial tyranny. The reason that this is a real issue that we need to think about",TAPPER
" Thank you, Governor.",TAPPER
" No, no. Let me finish this one thought, Jake. I havent gotten that much time, so Im going to take just what little I can here. We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard. We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo  Ive been to Gitmo, and Ive seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans.",HUCKABEE
" Youre telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo?",HUCKABEE
" Well, Im not telling you that, Governor. But Governor Bush is, because he  because he disagrees. He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law. You disagree? Youre not  you dont",TAPPER
 I dont think  youre not stating my views right.,BUSH
 OK. Please do.,TAPPER
" I think there needs to be accommodation for someone acting on faith. Religious conscience is  is  is a first freedom. Its  its a powerful part of our  of our Bill of Rights. And, in a big, tolerant country, we should respect the rule of law, allow people in  in  in this country  Im a  I was opposed to the decision, but we  you cant just say, well, they  gays cant get married now. But this woman, there should be some accommodation for her conscience, just as there should be for people that are florists that dont want to participate in weddings, or bakers. A great country like us should find a way to have accommodations for people so that we can solve the problem in the right way. This should be solved at the local level",BUSH
 You did,TAPPER
" And so we do agree, Mike.",BUSH
 I was  (CROSSTALK),CHRISTIE
" Governor, you said, quote, she is sworn to uphold the law.",TAPPER
" She is, and so if she, based on conscience, cant sign that  that marriage license, then there should be someone in her office to be able to do it, and if the law needs to be changed in the state of Kentucky, which is what shes advocating, it should be changed.",CHRISTIE
" Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash, who has a question.",TAPPER
" Governor Kasich, Senator Cruz is so committed to stripping federal funds from Planned Parenthood that it could result in shutting down the federal government in just about two weeks. Do you agree with Senator Cruzs tactic?",BASH
" Well, I agree that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I dont know many people in America who dont think that we should, and in my state, were trying to figure out how to get it done, because we are threatened with the federal government taking all of our Medicaid money away. I think there is a way to get this done by giving governors the ability to be able to act to defund Planned Parenthood. But when (ph) it comes to closing down the federal government, you gotta be very careful about that. When we shut the government down  if we have a chance at success and its a great principle, yes. The president of the United States is not going to sign this, and all were gonna do is shut the government down, and then were gonna open up  open it up, and the American people are gonna shake their heads and say, whats the story with these Republicans? So I think there is a way to get to cutting off the funding for Planned Parenthood. I was in the Congress for 18 years, balanced the budget, cut taxes, got it done. Changed welfare, went around the president to get welfare reform done. There are ways to do it without having to shut the government down, but Im sympathetic to the fact that we dont want this organization to get funding, and the money ought to be reprogrammed for family planning in other organizations that dont support this tactic. But I would not be for shutting the government down",KASICH
 Thank you.,BASH
 because I dont think its going to work out.,KASICH
" Thank you. Senator Cruz, I would just add that, on this stage not that long ago, Senator Graham said that this tactic that youre pushing would tank the Republicans ability to win in 2016.",BASH
" Well, let me tell you, Dana, number one, Im proud to stand for life. These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying. I would encourage every American to watch the videos. See  seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings, and then ask yourself, are these my values? These are horrifying. On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies. It is a felony with ten years jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. Thats what these videos show Planned Parenthood doing. Absolutely we shouldnt be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise, and Ill tell you, the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying, well give in because Obama threatens a veto. You know, Obamas committed to his principles. His liberal principles, he will fight for them. He says",CRUZ
" Thank you, senator.",BASH
" I will veto any budget that doesnt fund Planned Parenthood, and Republicans surrender. We need to stop surrendering and start standing",CRUZ
 Thank you,BASH
 for our principles. (CROSSTALK),CRUZ
" Governor  governor, I want to go to you. Is it what Senator Cruz says, a surrender by Republicans?",BASH
" Were not  what I can tell you is this. We didnt surrender in New Jersey, six years ago, as the brand new first ever pro-life governor of New Jersey since Roe versus Wade, I defended Planned Parenthood. And Ive vetoed Planned Parenthood funding, now, eight times in New Jersey. Since the day I walked in as governor, Planned Parenthood has not been funded in New Jersey. We stood up and every one of those vetoes has been sustained. But heres the problem, were  were fighting with each other up here. We agree. Lets ask Hillary Clinton. She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts",CHRISTIE
 But,BASH
" Dana, in a way that maximizes their value for sale for profit. It is disgusting, and the American people need to hear it",CHRISTIE
 But is it,BASH
" we shouldnt be fighting with each other. Shes the real opponent, shes the real problem.",CHRISTIE
" But, governor, the  but, governor, the reality is, in just two weeks time",BASH
" we are going to be facing a question about whether or not its enough to shut down the government to make that statement, because there is still a Democrat in the White House. Do you oppose it or support it?",BASH
" Ill tell you what  Ill tell you what Id be willing to fight for. Ill tell you what Id be willing to fight for. Why will (ph) we put tax reform on the presidents desk, so we can simplify this tax system?",CHRISTIE
" Yes or no, do you support this shutdown?",BASH
" No, no, its really important, Dana. We got to talk about what we would be willing to shut down for. Why dont we put tax reform on this presidents desk, and make him veto it if thats what he wants to do? Why havent we repealed and replaced Obamacare? Make him veto if thats what he wants to do.",CHRISTIE
 Were talking about Planned Parenthood right now.,BASH
 And why dont we do the same thing with Planned Parenthood?,CHRISTIE
 Can you answer yes or no?,BASH
" We elected a Republican Congress to do this. And they should be doing it, and theyre not. And theyre giving the president a pass.",CHRISTIE
" Dana, Id like to",FIORINA
" One more time. Im sorry, I just want to get the answer.",BASH
" I put it in the list, Dana. We should be doing these things and forcing the president to take action.",CHRISTIE
 So you would support a shutdown.,BASH
" Lets force him to do what he says hes going to do. Now I dont know whether hell do it or not, but lets force him to do it.",CHRISTIE
" Dana, I would like to link these two issues, both of which are incredibly important, Iran and Planned Parenthood. One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here, here is my plan. On day one in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls, the first to my good friend to Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel. The second, to the supreme leader, to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections by our people, not his, we, the United States of America, will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system. We can do that, we dont need anyones cooperation to do it. And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies. As regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.",FIORINA
" Dana, I want to continue on the subject. Governor Bush, you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood, quote, youre not sure we need a half billion for womens health issues. Now youve since said that you misspoke, you didnt mean to say womens health issues. But Donald Trump said that quote, that comment, which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately, will haunt you the same way Mitt Romneys 47 percent video haunted him. Tell Donald Trump why hes wrong.",TAPPER
" Well, hes wrong on a lot of things, but on this hes wrong because Im the most pro-life governor on this stage. I got to act on my core beliefs. Its part of who I am. Life is a gift from God. And from beginning end we need to respect it and err on the side of life. And so I defunded Planned Parenthood. We created a climate where parental notification took place. We were the only state to fund crisis pregnancy centers with state moneys. We were totally focused on this. And I would bring that kind of philosophy to Washington, D.C. So here is a solution to this. Title X of the HHS funding, there is something that was the Reagan Rule. It was passed in 1988. And in that rule it was defined, and the courts approved this, that a Planned Parenthood, you couldnt separate the money between the actual abortion procedures, and there are 330,000 abortions that take place in this clinic, and their promotion of it. He interpreted it the right way, the courts ruled in his favor, and Planned Parenthood did not get funding during that time until President Clinton came in. When Im elected president, we will restore that interpretation of Title X. And this deal will be finished.",BUSH
" Thank you, Governor Bush. Donald Trump, let me just",TAPPER
" Jeb, just",TRUMP
" The quote was, Im not sure we need half a billion dollars for womens health issues. He said he misspoke. You said that thats going to haunt him. Why do you think that?",TAPPER
" I think it will haunt him. I think its a terrible. I think its going to haunt him absolutely. He came back later and he said he misspoke. There was no question because I heard when he said the statement. I was watching and he said the statement. And I said, wow, I cant believe it. I will take care of women. I respect women. I will take care of women. One thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation. Were talking about Iran. The agreement was terrible. It was incompetent. Ive never seen anything like it. One of the worst contracts of any kind Ive ever seen. And nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea. And Ted and I have spoken. Weve  a lot of us have spoken. Were talking about Iran. They are bad actors, bad things are going to happen. But in the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, Im ready to use them. And we dont even mention it.",TRUMP
 Governor Bush?,TAPPER
" There are 13,000 community-based organizations that provide health services to women, 13,000 in this country. I dont believe that Planned Parenthood should get a penny from the federal government. Those organizations should get funding, just as I increased funding when I was governor of the state. Thats the way you do this is you improve the condition for people. And, Donald, when I was governor, we also increased the opportunities for women. Womens income grew three times faster than the national average when I was governor.",BUSH
 So why didnt you say it? Why didnt you say it?,TRUMP
 We improved  we improved ,BUSH
" I know, but why did you say it? I heard it myself. Why did you say it?",TRUMP
  we increased child support  we increased child support with a broken system by 90 percent.,BUSH

 I have a proven record. I have a proven record.,BUSH
 You said it.,TRUMP
 I want to  were going to get to ,TAPPER
" Jake, just one more moment. This is  theres something bigger to this. Now, I  like so many other governors here, I defunded Planned Parenthood four-and-a-half years ago, in a Blue State. But its bigger than that. We did that in a Blue State, we took the money and put it into womens health, so we did exactly what were talking about here. But I think the bigger issue here is we should be able to do this nationally, and this is precisely why so many Republicans are upset with Washington. They see the House and they see the Senate and they say why cant we pass this. Why cant we defund Planned  put it in a spending bill. Forget about the 60-vote rule, theres no reason  and the Constitution doesnt call for 60 votes. Pass it with 51 votes, put it on the desk of the president ",WALKER

" Were going to  were going to get to many of these issues. This  were still in the first block, believe it or not. Were going to get to many of these issues, but before we end this block, Ms. Fiorina, I do want to ask you about this. In an interview last week in Rolling Stone magazine, Donald Trump said the following about you. Quote, Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?

" Welcome to CNNs Republican Presidential Debate. No topic perhaps has been more combustible in this campaign than the issue of immigration. Mr. Trump, you have called for deporting every undocumented immigrant, Governor Christie has said, quote, There are not enough law enforcement officers  local, county, state and federal combined  to forcibly deport 11 to 12 million people. Tell Governor Christie how much your plan will cost, and how you will get it done.",TAPPER
" Correct. First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works. So important, and its a big part of it. Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside, and I think Chris knows that, maybe as well as anybody. They go, if I get elected, first day theyre gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you look. We have a country based on laws. I will make sure that those laws are adhered to. These are illegal immigrants. I dont think youd even be asking this question if I didnt run because when I ran, and I brought this up, my opening remarks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. And, then they found out with the killing of Katie, from San Francisco, and so many other crimes, they found out that I was right. And, most people, many people, apologized to me. I dont think youd even be talking about illegal immigration if it werent for me. So, we have a country of laws, theyre going to go out, and theyll come back if they deserve to come back. If theyve had a bad record, if theyve been arrested, if theyve been in jail, theyre never coming back. Were going to have a country again. Right now, we dont have a country, we dont have a border, and were going to do something about it, and it can be done with proper management, and it can be done with heart.",TRUMP
" Governor Christie, you and I have talked about this in an interview. You say that his big wall, his plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, it sounds great, but its never going to happen. Tell him why youre skeptical of his plans?",TAPPER
" First of, Jake, I dont yield to anybody on how to enforce the law. Im the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a United States Attorney after September 11th, and I know how to do this. The fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding, and the current number of law enforcement officers. Heres what we need to do, and I think this is where Donald is absolutely right. What we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall. We need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use FBI, DEA, and ATF, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, You have overstayed your welcome, youre taking advantage of the American people. Its time for you to go. If we had that kind of system in place, we wouldnt have the 11 million people we have now.",CHRISTIE
" Thank you, Governor Christie",TAPPER
" By the way, I agree with  with what Chris is saying, but, I will say this. Illegal immigration is costing us more than $200 billion dollars a year just to maintain what we have.",TRUMP
" I want to bring in Dr. Carson because he too has been skeptical of your plan to immediately deport 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants. He said, quote, People who say that have no idea what this entails. Why do you say that, Dr. Carson?",TAPPER
" Well, first of all, I recognize that we have an incredible illegal immigration problem. I was down in Arizona a few weeks ago at the border. I mean, the fences that were there were not manned, and those are the kind of fences when I was a kid that would barely slow us down. So, I dont see any purpose in having that. Now, what we need to do is look at something that actually works. Yuma County, Arizona. They stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. They put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people. If we dont seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesnt matter. Its kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about. We have the ability to do it, we dont have the will to do it. There was one area where they had cut a hole in the fence, and to repair it, they put a few strands of barb wire across. Well, the photographers who were there with us, they wanted to photograph us from the side of the Mexicans, and they went through there, and they were not physically fit people, and they took their cameras and things with them, and shot us from the other side. Thats how easy it is to get across. And, the drugs, I mean, it goes on, and on, and on. ICE tells them to release these people, 67,000 criminals released",CARSON
 Dr. Carson,TAPPER
" on to our property, its ridiculous.",CARSON
" With all due respect, you said about Donald Trumps plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, People who say that have no idea what this entails. Why not?",TAPPER
" Well, I have also said, if anybody knows how to do that, that I would be willing to listen. And, if they can, you know, specify exactly how thats going to be done, and what the cost, and it sounds reasonable, then I think its worth discussing TRUMP(?): (INAUDIBLE)",CARSON
 lets continue the conversation about illegal immigration with Dana Bash.,TAPPER
" Governor Bush, Mr. Trump has suggested that your views on immigration are influenced by your Mexican born wife. He said that, quote, If my wife were from Mexico, I think I would have a soft spot for people from Mexico. Did Mr. Trump go to far in invoking your wife?",BASH
" He did, he did. Youre proud of your family, just as I am.",BUSH

" To subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald.",BUSH

But she wants to embrace the traditional American values that make us special and make us unique. Were at a crossroads right now. Are we going to take the Reagan approach, the hopeful optimistic approach, the approach that says that, you come to our country legally, you pursue your dreams with a vengeance, you create opportunities for all of us? Or the Donald Trump approach? The approach that says that everything is bad, that everything is coming to an end. I",BUSH

 We have been talking about it for 25 years. This is why people are tired of politicians.,FIORINA
" Ms. Fiorina  Ms. Fiorina, were going to come to you, were going to come to you. I just want to give Governor Bush a chance to respond to what Mr. Trump said. BUSH: Look, first of all, I wrote a book about this, three  four years ago, now. And I laid out a comprehensive, conservative approach for immigration reform. And it does require securing the border. No one disagrees with that. But to build a wall, and to deport people  half a million a month  would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, Donald. Hundreds of billions of dollars. It would destroy community life, it would tear families apart. And it would send a signal to the rest of the world that the United States values that are so important for our long-term success no longer matter in this country.",BASH
" As I said, we are spending $200 billion  we are spending $200 billion a year on maintaining what we have. We will move them out. The great ones will come back, the good ones will come back. Theyll be expedited, theyll be back, theyll come back legally. Well have a country  theyll come back, legally.",TRUMP
" OK, on that note, you have criticized Governor Bush for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail. You said, quote, He should really set an example by speaking English in the United States. Whats wrong with speaking Spanish?",BASH
" Well, I think its wonderful and all, but I did it a little bit half-heartedly, but I do mean it to a large extent. We have a country, where, to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was, and the way it came out didnt sound right to me. We have to have assimilation  to have a country, we have to have assimilation. Im not the first one to say this, Dana. Weve had many people over the years, for many, many years, saying the same thing. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.",TRUMP
" Well, Ive been speaking English here tonight, and Ill keep speaking English. But the simple fact is, if a high school kid asks me a question in Spanish, a school  by the way, a voucher program that was created under my watch, the largest voucher program in the country, where kids can go to a Christian school, and they ask me a question in Spanish, Im going to show respect and answer that question in Spanish. Even though they do speak English, and even though they embrace American values.",BUSH
" This is a reporter, not a high school kid.",TRUMP
" Ms. Dana, I agree that English is the unifying language of our country, and everyone should learn to speak it. Its important. I want to tell you a story about someone that didnt speak English that well. It was my grandfather; he came to this country in the 1960s, as a  escaping Cuba. And he lived with us, growing up. And my grandfather loved America. He understood what was so special about this country. He loved Ronald Reagan; he would be very proud of the fact that were here this evening. My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve. But he taught me that in Spanish, because it was the language he was most comfortable in. And he became a conservative, even though he got his news in Spanish. And so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and heres why  because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility. And if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.",RUBIO
" Thank you, Senator Rubio.",TAPPER
" Senator Cruz  Senator Cruz, this week, we learned more about Dr. Carsons plan for the 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country. Dr. Carson proposed giving these undocumented immigrants a six- month grace period to pay back taxes then to let them become guest workers and only to deport people who failed to do that.",TAPPER
 Not exactly what I said.,CARSON
" Well, how would you say it, sir? I was just reading the Wall Street Journal quote, but please tell us.",TAPPER
" Well, what I said, after we seal the borders, after we turn off the spigot that dispenses all the goodies so we dont have people coming in here, including employment, that people who had a pristine record, we should consider allowing them to become guest workers, primarily in the agricultural sphere, because thats the place where Americans dont seem to want to work. Thats what I said. And they have a six-month period to do that. If they dont do it within that time period, then they become illegal, and as illegals, they will be treated as such.",CARSON
" OK, from the horses mouth, Senator Cruz, does that fit your definition of amnesty?",TAPPER
" Well, Jake, you know, Im  Im very glad that Donald Trumps being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration. I think thats very important. I like and respect Ben Carson. Ill let him talk about his own plans. But I will say this: The natural next question that primary voters are asking, after we focus on illegal immigration is, okay, what are the records of the various candidates? And this is an issue on which there are stark differences. A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and, in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan. In 2013, when Barack Obama and Harry Reid joined the Washington Republicans in a massive, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions helping lead the fight. You know, folks here have talked about, how do you secure the borders? Well, Ive been leading the fight in the Senate to triple the Border Patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit/entry system",CRUZ
" Thank you, Senator. Senator Rubio",TAPPER
 Can I  can I  can I just,CARSON
  Im not sure,TAPPER
 Can I correct,CARSON
" Well come back to you  well come back to you in one second, sir. But Senator Rubio, Im not sure exactly whose plan hes  hes saying is  constitutes amnesty, but I know he has said it about your plan in the past, so I want to give you a chance to respond, then, Dr. Carson, well come to you.",TAPPER
 OK.,CARSON
" Well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper. Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with. My familys immigrants. My neighbors are all immigrants. My in-laws are all immigrants. So Ive seen every aspect of it, and I can tell you America doesnt have one immigration problem, it has three. First, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally. Second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. It primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit. And third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally. And we must deal with all three of these problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. I learned that. We tried it that way. Heres the way forward: First, we must  we must secure our border, the physical border, with  with a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. We also need a mandatory e-verify system. After weve done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here. And after weve done those two things, I believe the American people",RUBIO
" Thank you, Senator.",TAPPER
"  will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone whos been here and isnt a criminal. If youre a criminal, obviously, you will not be able to stay.",RUBIO
" Thank you, Senator. Senator  Dr. Carson  I want to give you 30 seconds. Id like you to answer the question. Senator Cruz describes plans such as yours as amnesty. Why is your plan not amnesty?",TAPPER
" My plan is not amnesty for a number of reasons. Number one, you know, Ive talked to farmers, and they said they cannot hire Americans to do the kind of job that Im talking about. And the second reason is because the individuals who register as guest workers, they dont get to vote, they are not American citizens, and they dont get the rights and privileges of American citizens. So thats key. But the other thing that I want to bring up is, I mentioned something earlier. I think it was just sort of glossed over. I talked about the success in Yuma County, I mean, incredible success, and the Department of Justice said, No, we dont want to do that. Thats too successful. We dont have to keep reinventing the wheel. All we have to do is look at things that work. All we have to do is use a little common sense.",CARSON
" Thank you, Dr. Carson. I want to talk about the issue of birthright citizenship, which  which has emerged since the first debate as  as an a  a major issue in this campaign. Mr. Trump, you say that babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrants should not any longer get automatic American citizenship. Ms. Fiorina says that you are pandering on this issue and acting like the politicians that you rail against. Whats your message to Ms. Fiorina on birthright citizenship?",TAPPER
" Well, first of all, the  the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars  not television scholars, but legal scholars  that it is wrong. It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesnt even need that. A woman gets pregnant. Shes nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I dont think so. And by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesnt have that. Were the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it. And people  and by the way, this is not just with respect to Mexico. They are coming from Asia to have babies here, and all of a sudden, we have to take care of the babies for the life of the baby. The 14th Amendment, it reads properly, you can go and  its probably going to be have to be check  go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court, but there are a lot of great legal scholars that say that is not correct. And in my opinion, it makes absolutely no  were the only  one of the only countries, were going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years? I dont think so.",TRUMP
" Ms. Fiorina, the vast majority of countries do not have birthright citizenship",TAPPER
 Donald Trump is right about that. Why is it pandering when hes  he says this?,TAPPER
" First let me say, We have just spent a good bit of time discussing, as Republicans, how to solve this problem. I would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question. Why have Democrats not solved this problem? President Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem. He entered Washington with majorities in the House and the Senate. He could have chosen to do anything to solve this pro  this problem. Instead, he chose to do nothing. Why? because the Democrats dont want this issue solved.",FIORINA
 Ms. Fiorina,TAPPER
 They want it to be an issue that they can use. As to birthright citizenship,FIORINA
 Please.,TAPPER
" the truth is, you cant just wave your hands and say the 14th Amendment is gonna go away. It will take an extremely arduous vote in Congress, followed by two-thirds of the states, and if that doesnt work to amend the Constitution, then it is a long, arduous process in court. And meanwhile, what will continue to go on is what has gone on for 25 years. With all due respect, Mr. Trump, weve been talking about illegal immigration for 25 years. San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989. There are 300 of them. And meanwhile, what has happened? Nothing. The border remains insecure. The legal immigration system remains broken. Look, we know what it takes to secure a border. Weve heard a lot of great ideas here. Money, manpower, technology TAPPER : Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.",FIORINA
" mostly, apparently, leadership",FIORINA
 Thank you.,TAPPER
 the kind of leadership that understands how to get results.,FIORINA
" Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond",TAPPER
" I agree 100 percent, by the way, with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem, for the obvious reasons, but they do not. But I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it cant be done. Ive seen both sides, but some of the greatest scholars agree with me, without having to go through Congress. If you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem. TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul",TRUMP
" But you  you would stipulate, Mr. Trump, but not everyone agrees with you.",FIORINA
" Thats true, sure.",TRUMP
 OK.,FIORINA
" Senator Paul, I want to bring you in. Where  where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?",TAPPER
" Well, I hate to say it, but Donald Trump has a bit of a point here. The case that was decided around 1900 was, people had a green card, were here legally, and they said that their children were citizens. Theres never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens. So it hasnt really been completely adjudicated. The 14th Amendment says that those who are here and under the jurisdiction. The original author of the  of the 14th Amendment said on the Senate floor that this was applying to slaves, and did not specifically apply to others.",PAUL
" All right. Senator Paul, thank you so much. Lets turn to a new topic. Weve received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs. We have two CEOs on stage right now. Ms. Fiorina, you were CEO of Hewlett Packard. Donald Trump says you, quote, ran HP into the ground, you laid off tens of thousands of people, you got viciously fired. For voters looking to somebody with private-sector experience to create American jobs, why should they pick you and not Donald Trump?",TAPPER
" I led Hewlett Packard through a very difficult time, the worst technology recession in 25 years. The NASDAQ stock index fell 80 percent. It took 15 years for the stock index to recover. We had very strong competitors who literally went out of business and lost all of their jobs in the process. Despite those difficult times, we doubled the size of the company, we quadrupled its topline growth rate, we quadrupled its cash flow, we tripled its rate of innovation. Yes, we had to make tough choices, and in doing so, we saved 80,000 jobs, went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And now Hewlett Packard is almost 300,000 jobs. We went from lagging behind to leading in every product category and every market segment. We must lead in this nation again, and some tough calls are going to be required. But as for the firing, I have been very honest about this from the day it happened. When you challenge the status quo, you make enemies. I made a few. Steve Jobs told me that when he called me the day I was fired to say, hey, been there, done that twice. Its also true that the man that led my firing, Tom Perkins, just took ",FIORINA
" Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.",TAPPER

" Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump, why would you be better at creating jobs than Carly Fiorina?",TAPPER
"  let me  well, let me just explain. The head of the Yale Business School, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, wrote a paper recently, one of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen, ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business. The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster. They still havent recovered. In fact, today, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25 or 30,000 people saying we still havent recovered from the catastrophe. When Carly says the revenues went up, thats because she bought Compaq, it was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company. Now one other company before that was Lucent. Carly was at Lucent before that. And Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also. So I only say this. She cant run any of my companies. That I can tell you.",TRUMP
" Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you a chance to respond.",TAPPER
" You know, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is a well-known Clintonite and honestly had it out for me from the moment that I arrived at Hewlett Packard. But honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this. You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other peoples money. That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other peoples money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once ",FIORINA
 I never filed for bankruptcy.,TRUMP

I completely agree that whats at stake here is the future of this nation, and the future of every American. But I do think that a track record of leadership is vital because in the end this election is about leadership. And lets talk about what leadership is. Its not about braggadocio, it is about challenging the status quo, solving problems, producing results. And the highest calling of leadership is to unlock potential in others.",FIORINA

" Donald Trump says that the hedge fund guys are getting away with murder by paying a lower tax rate. He wants to raise the taxes of hedge fund managers, as does Governor Bush. Do you agree?",TAPPER
" I dont at this point in terms of changing the incentives for investment and risk-taking. But lets just stop for a second. Theres one person on this stage that does have a record. Im the only person on the stage and one of the few people in this country that led the effort as the chief architect of the last time we balanced the federal budget. We also cut taxes. And when I left Washington in 2000, we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming. I had spent 10 years of my life to get us to that point, went out in the private sector, was a great experience, and went into Ohio and took an $8 billion hole and turned it into a $2 billion surplus. Weve had the largest amount of tax cuts of any sitting governor. Weve grown well over 300,000 jobs. You see, Ive done it in both places. Im the only one here that has done it in both places. It took a lot to get us to a balanced budget. It was legitimate. It was real. And we negotiated it. A lot of what were talking about here tonight as we take this position and that position, you know what? At the end of the day, America has got to work. Weve got to figure out how we come together to deal with this  with our fiscal problems because when we deal with that, we create a stronger economy for everybody. People have a chance to rise. So, you know, when we think about how we make a choice, its the person that lands that plane. Its not somebody that talks about it. Its about the person who has done it. And Ive done it in",KASICH
" Thank you, Governor.",TAPPER
  both places. And I did it including people in the other party. And thats how we were successful.,KASICH
" Thank you, Governor Kasich.",TAPPER
" And thats how I will be president, using that experience to drive this country forward. Thank you.",KASICH
" Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in on the question of hedge fund managers and taxing them. You have said that you are bothered by the fact that hedge fund managers pay such a low tax rate and make 2,500 times what people who work for them make. Do you agree with what Donald Trump and Governor Bush have proposed, raising their tax rates?",TAPPER
" I have a different idea. I think we ought to get rid of all the taxes on people who produce. Why should we penalize productivity? And its why Im an unabashed supporter of the fair tax, which would be a tax on our consumption, rather than a tax on our productivity. In other words, youre not going to tax anybody for what they earn, whether its worker whose working by the hour or whether its a hedge fund manager. If they can produce something and bring capital and labor to create jobs, we need some jobs. And I think the fair tax makes more sense. Now, Jake, Ive been listening to everybody on the stage and there is a lot of back and forth about Im the only one who has done this, the only one who has done that, Ive done great things. Weve all done great things or we wouldnt be on this stage. But it occurs to me as were sitting here in the Reagan Library that most of us would like to pay tribute to a guy who, when he got elected, didnt get elected telling everybody how great he was. He got elected telling everybody how great the American people were. And he empowered them to live their dreams, which is what Id love to see us do by no longer penalizing the people who are out there working because they are taking a gut punch right now.",HUCKABEE
" Thank you, Governor. Dr. Carson, you support scrapping the entire tax code and replacing it with a flat tax based on the principal on tithing from the Bible. If you make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion in taxes, if you make $10, you pay $1 in taxes. Donald Trump believes in progressive taxation. He says its not right that rich people pay the same as the poor. Tell Donald Trump why his ideas on taxes are wrong.",TAPPER
" Its all about America. You know, the people who say the guy who paid a billion dollars because he had 10, he has still got $9 billion left, thats not fair, we need to take more of his money. Thats called socialism. That doesnt work so well. What made America into a great nation was the fact that we said, that guy just put in $1 billion, lets create an environment thats even more conducive to his success so that next year he can put in $2 billion. And thats the kind of thing that helps us to grow. We cant grow by continuing to take a piece of pie, and dividing it, and redistributing it. But, Im also looking at what doctor  at what Governor Huckabee talked about",CARSON
" You dont want me operating on you, I assure you. (LAUGHTER)",HUCKABEE
" The Fair Tax. Looking at both of them, and evaluating them both, and Im talking to the American people because one of the things we must recognize is that this country is of, for, and by the people. And, its really time that the government get out of the way, and let the people be the ones who decide how they want to run their country.",CARSON
 Mr. Trump,TAPPER
" Well, Id like to respond, Id like to respond",TRUMP
 What do you think of the flat tax? Do you think its fair?,TAPPER
" Well, I think the thing about the flat tax, I know it very well. What I dont like is that if you make $200 million a year, you pay ten percent, youre paying very little relatively to somebody thats making $50,000 a year, and has to hire H&R Block to do the  because its so complicated. One thing Ill say to Ben is that weve had a graduated tax system for many years, so its not a socialistic thing. What Id like to do, and Ill be putting in the plan in about two weeks, and I think people are going to like it, its a major reduction in taxes. Its a major reduction for the middle class. The hedge fund guys wont like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but theyll pay more. I know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax, and I think its unfair.",TRUMP
" Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul?",TAPPER
" Well, Im glad were having a discussion about taxes because everybody laments that we lose jobs overseas, we have. Our companies, and our jobs are being chased overseas by a 70,000 page tax code, so, thats why Ive chosen to get rid of the whole thing, and have one single rate, 14 and a-half percent for everybody, business, and for corporate income, and personal income. But, we also get rid of the payroll tax, so the working class would get a tax break as well. So, I think a flat tax, eliminating the tax code, getting rid of all the loopholes, is the way to go, and its the way we get America going again.",PAUL
" Governor Walker, I want to go to you. Dr. Carson wants to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, you have called it a lame idea. Why is raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame?",TAPPER
" So, the best way to help people see their wages go up is to get them the education, the skill they need, to take on careers that pay more than minimum wage. And, its why we talk about it, its all about jobs. You want to help actually get jobs, its why on that last question we were trying to jump in on taxes. To me, its not just about taxes, cutting taxes. Ive done it as much as anyone has. Ive cut income taxes, Ive cut property taxes. In fact, property taxes are lower today in my state than they were before we took office. The real issues about jobs. Ronald Reagan, our plan is based on the Ronald Reagan tax cuts of 1986. That brought about one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in American history. All the things we should be talking about tonight are about how do we create jobs, helping people get the skills and the education qualifications they need to succeed. Thats the way you help people create jobs. Its part of our large plan to reform the tax code, to cut taxes, to put in place an education system that gives people the skills and education that they need. To put in place all the above energy policy, but you start on day one with repealing Obamacare. Im the only one on this stage thats actually got a plan, introduced an actual plan to repeal Obamacare on day one. Ill send a bill up to Congress, and to make sure enact it",WALKER
" Thank you, Governor",TAPPER
" Im going to sign an order that makes the Congress live by the same rules as everybody else. TAPPER: Thank you, Governor",WALKER
 That will ensure they repeal Obamacare,WALKER
" Dr. Carson, Governor Walker didnt really answer the question, but Ill let you respond. He called raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame, what do you think of that?",TAPPER
" Well, first of all, let me say what I actually said about raising the minimum wage. I was asked should it be raised, I said, probably, or possibly. But, what I added, which I think is the most important thing, so, I said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down, and talk about it. Negotiate a reasonable minimum wage, and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America. I think we also have to have two minimum wages, a starter, and a sustaining because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes it impractical to hire them",CARSON
" Thank you, Dr. Carson",TAPPER
" Jake, Jake, Jake, I just want to address that issue because you said I didnt answer, and I did. I said, to me, I think the real focus shouldnt be  you know, Hillary Clinton talks about the minimum wage. Thats her answer to grow the economy. The answer is to give people the skills and the education so they make far more than minimum wage. I dont want to argue about how low things are going to be, I want to talk about how do we lift everyone up in America. Thats what Reagan talked about. It wasnt how bad things were, it was how to make it better for everyone. Thats what weve done in Wisconsin, thats exactly what wed do as",WALKER
" Let me bring in our partner from Salem Radio Network, Hugh Hewitt.",TAPPER
" Id like to talk about winning because I think all of you are more qualified than former Secretary of State Clinton, and as were the people in the first debate, but there are different styles, and Carly Fiorina, Governor Kasich, youre conveniently located next to each other, and you have different styles. Governor Kasich, youve been on my show a lot. You refused to attack Hillary Clinton, you just dont want to go there, you want to do the up with people. Go, Ohio, OK, and I like that. Carly Fiorina, I dont have to bring up the Secretary of State  you bring her up, so (inaudible). Which one of you is wrong? Governor Kasich?",HEWITT
" Well, look, people still have to get to know me, so I want to spend my time talking about my experience reforming welfare, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, providing economic growth when I was in Washington, turning Ohio around. Eight billion in the hole, $2 billion surplus, up over 300,000 jobs, big tax cuts, strengthening our credit. All those things matter but, you know, as a young man in my first election in 1978, I defeated an incumbent Democrat. I defeated an incumbent Democrat in 1982; running on the Reagan program, I was the only Republican in America to defeat an incumbent Democrat that year. And then, when I won for election of governor, I was the first Republican to defeat an incumbent in 36 years, and the first person to have never run statewide out of politics for 10 years to beat an incumbent. That hadnt happened for 96 years. So, well get to the point where well talk about Hillary Clinton, or whoever the nominee is, record. But right now, I want to give people sense of hope, sense of purpose, a sense of unity, sense that we can do it. So",KASICH
 Governor.,HEWITT
" You know, at the end of the day, Im going to continue to talk about my record, because there is, did you ever notice when people run for office, they run for president, they make a lot of promises, they dont keep them.",KASICH
" Thank you, Governor. KASICH: I dont intend to do that, and I going to be out there pushing it out  dont worry about me and Hillary. That will all work out, and Im from Ohio. She will not beat me there, I can promise you that.",HEWITT
" Carly Fiorina, your style?",HEWITT
" You see, Governor Christie, people spend time talking about their track records, and Mr. Trump and I have every right to do the same. And Mrs. Clinton has to defend her track record. Her track record of lying about Benghazi, of lying about her e- mails, about lying about her servers. She does not have a track record of accomplishment. Like Mrs. Clinton, I, too, have travels hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know flying is an activity, not an accomplishment. Mrs. Clinton  if you want to stump a Democrat, ask them to name a accomplishment of Mrs. Clintons.",FIORINA
" Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. Governor Christie, your name was mentioned. I want to give you a chance to respond.",HEWITT
" Listen, you know, Hugh, its an important point. And the question is, who is going to prosecute Hillary Clinton? The Obama White House seems to have in interest, the Justice Department seems to have no interest. I think its time to put a former federal prosecutor on the same stage as Hillary Clinton. And I will prosecute her during those debates on that stage for the record were talking about here. The fact she had a private email server in her basement, using national security secrets running through it, could have been hacked by the Russians, the Chinese, or two 18-year-olds on a toot (ph) wanting to have some fun. No one is answering that question from the Hillary Clinton campaign",CHRISTIE
" Thank you, Governor.",HEWITT

" Welcome back to CNNs Republican Presidential Debate. Lets turn to some issues now in foreign policy. Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio said it was, quote, very concerning to him that in a recent interview you didnt seem to know the details about some of the enemies the U.S. faces. Rubio said, if you dont know the answers to those questions, you will not be able to serve as commander-in-chief. Please respond to Senator Rubio.",TAPPER
" Well, I heard Hugh Hewitt, a nice man, he apologized because he actually said that we had a misunderstanding. And he said today that Donald Trump is maybe the best interview there is anywhere that he has ever done. Now unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice, but he did say that (CROSSTALK)",TRUMP
" Oh, youre the best interview in America.",HEWITT
 And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word. But I would say just (LAUGHTER),TRUMP
" Well, I think it was. And he actually said that. Did you say that? (CROSSTALK)",TRUMP
  makes an interesting case (ph) here (ph).,HEWITT
" OK. So I will say this, though, Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names. I think he was reading them off a sheet. And frankly I will have  and I told him, I will have the finest team that anybody has put together and we will solve a lot of problems. You know, right now they know a lot and look at what is happening. The world is blowing up around us. We will have great teams and great people.",TRUMP
 Senator Rubio?,TAPPER
" I hope that answers your question. I mean, you are in the Senate, but I hope that answers your question.",TRUMP
" Yes, well, it does. But its in the following way, this is an important question. I think if youre running for president, these are important issues, because look at around the world today. There is a lunatic in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons and long-range rocket that can already hit the very place in which we stand tonight. The Chinese are rapidly expanding their military. They hack into our computers. Theyre building artificial islands in the South China Sea, the most important shipping lane in the world. A gangster in Moscow is not just threatening Europe, hes threatening to destroy and divide NATO. You have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents. And they even recruit Americans using social media to try to attack us here at home. And now we have got this horrible deal with Iran where a radical Shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the United States. These are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in. And the next president of the United States better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them because the number one issue that a president will ever confront, and the most important obligation that the federal government has, is to keep this nation safe. And today we are not doing that. We are eviscerating our military. And we have a president that is more respectful to the ayatollah in Iran than he is to the prime minister of Israel.",RUBIO
 Mr. Trump? Senator Rubio seemed to be suggesting that you dont know information that,TAPPER
" No, I dont think hes suggesting that at all. I mean (CROSSTALK)",TRUMP
 All right. Senator Rubio.,TAPPER
 I dont think hes suggesting that at all.,TRUMP
" Well, thats why we have a debate. I think that we should have a deeper debate about these issues, because there is no more important decision that a president will make.",RUBIO
 But are you saying that you have the knowledge to be the president that Mr. Trump does not have?,TAPPER
" Well, you should ask him questions in detail about the foreign policy issues our president will confront, because you had better be able to lead our country on the first day. Not six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. You cant predict it. Sometimes you cannot control it. And it is the most  the federal government does all kinds of things its not supposed to be doing. It regulates bathrooms. It regulates schools that belong to local communities. But the one thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office.",RUBIO
 Mr. Trump?,TAPPER
" Well, you have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today. Number one. I am not sitting in the United States Senate. Im a businessman doing business transactions.",TRUMP
" Trust (ph) me, I get that. OK.",RUBIO
" I am doing business transactions. I will know more about this  and, as you said, that was very acceptable, and when you listen to that whole interview, its a great interview, you said it, I didnt. Well, now I did. But (CROSSTALK)",TRUMP
" Listen, just one second. Just one second.",TRUMP
" I never get to addressed, and",RUBIO
 I will know,TRUMP
" and when I do, Im gonna jump in.",RUBIO
" I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit, and you look at whats going in this world right now by people that supposedly know, this world is a mess. TAPPER: Senator Rubio, he did invoke your absentee record in the Senate.",TRUMP
" Yeah. He did. Let me  Im proud to serve in the United States Senate. You know, when I ran five years ago, the entire leadership of my party in Washington lined up against me. But Im glad I won. And Im glad that I ran, because this countrys headed in the wrong direction. And if we keep electing the same people, nothing is going to change. And youre right, I have missed some votes, and Ill tell you why, Mr. Trump. Because in my years in the Senate, Ive figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people. You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it. We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in  in  in debt, and theyre about to raise the debt limit again. We have a world that grows increasingly dangerous, and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with Iran. And these  if this thing continues, we are going to be the first Americans to leave our children worse off than ourselves. Thats why Im missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, Im not running for re-election, and Im running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.",RUBIO
" Thank you, Senator Rubio. I want to turn now to Hugh Hewitt.",TAPPER
" Thank you, Jake. Ive done a lot of great interviews with all of you, but, Governor Bush, I talked to you in February about the biggest elephant in a room full of elephants, which is your last name. And you said you would not be burdened either by your brother or your fathers legacy in the Middle East. And then, a week later, you rolled out your list of foreign policy advisers, and it was a lot of the band getting back together again. So on behalf of the military that is watching",HEWITT
 Yeah.,BUSH
" OK, the active duty military that are at the end of the sphere (ph), what kind of a commander in chief is Jeb Bush going to be, and who are the advisers that are new to your team?",HEWITT
" Well, first of all, Hugh, if youre looking at Republican advisers, you have to go to the last two administrations. That happened to be 41 and 43. So just by definition, if youre  and many of the people here that are seeking advice from the foreign policy experts in the Republican side, they  they served in my dads administration, my brothers administration. Of course thats the case. But Im my own man. Im going to create a strategy that is based on the simple fact that the United States needs to lead the world. The first thing that we need to do is to stop the craziness of the sequester. Rebuild our military so that our  so that we dont deploy people over and over again without the necessary equipment to keep them safe, to send a signal to the world that were serious. If were going to lead the world, then we need to have the strongest military possible. We need to rebuild our counterintelligence and intelligence capabilities. We need to focus on the fact that the next president is going to start in 2017, not in 1990  you know, 30 years ago, or when my brother started. The world is dramatically different. And I believe that we need to restore Americas presence and leadership in the world. Name a country where our relationship is better today than it was the  the day that Barack Obama got elected president. Under Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, we have seen a weakness that now creates huge problems for the next president of the United States. So Ill have a team that will be  that will be following the doctrine I set up, and it will be peace through strength. Were sitting here in this library, which is a wonderful place to talk about this, because thats exactly what happened in the 1980s, and the world was a lot safer because of",BUSH

" I want to ask you a question, though, you promised us great leaders. And I believe that. But Jeb Bush has laid out 20 different people that have experience around the world. There are 190 countries, you cant run the world by yourself. When are we going to get some names on your military and your foreign policy advisers?",HEWITT
" (inaudible) Im  and Im meeting with people that are terrific people, but I have to say something because its about judgment. I am the only person on this dais  the only person  that fought very, very hard against us (ph), and I wasnt a sitting politician going into Iraq, because I said going into Iraq  that was in 2003, you can check it out, check out  Ill give you 25 different stories.",TRUMP

" Just excuse me, one second, Rand",TRUMP
 Can I make a response to that?,PAUL
" If you dont mind, Rand  you know, you are on last  you do have your 1 percent. I would like  and I think its very important. I think its important, because its about judgment. Its about judgment. I didnt want to go into Iraq, and I fought it, because what I said  what I said",TRUMP

" Right after me, and then Ill  Ill yield  yield the floor. What do you guys say in the Senate when youre talking and debating?",BUSH
 Absolutely. Go ahead.,PAUL
" Heres the facts: When Donald Trump talks about judgment, what was his position on who wouldve been the best negotiator to deal with Iran? It wasnt a Republican; it was Hillary Clinton. Thats what you believe. I mean, the lack of judgment and the lack of understanding about how the world works is really dangerous in this kind of time that were saying. So is that the judgment that you bring to the table, that Hillary Clinton",BUSH
 If you think about it,TRUMP
"  is a great negotiator, that she could bring about a better deal on Iran?",BUSH

 May I respond?,PAUL

But I would ask the American people, look at whos been tested. When there were 100,000 protesters in my capital, I didnt back down, when they issued death threats against me and threats against my family, I didnt back down, when they tried to recall me, I didnt back down, and when they made me the  one of their number-one targets last year, I didnt back down.

" The remark was made that there hadnt been anyone else on the podium opposed to the Iraq War. Ive made my career as being an opponent of the Iraq War. I was opposed to the Syria war. I was opposed to arming people who are our enemies. Iran is now stronger because Hussein is gone. Hussein was the great bulwark and counterbalance to the Iranians. So when we complain about the Iranians, you need to remember that the Iraq War made it worse. Originally, Governor Bush was asked, was the Iraq War a mistake, and he said, No. Wed do it again. We have to learn sometimes the interventions backfire. The Iraq War backfired and did not help us. Were still paying the repercussions of a bad decision.",PAUL

" Thank you, Senator Paul (CROSSTALK)",TAPPER
" I understand that Governor Bushs name has been invoked, and then we can go to you, Senator Rubio. BUSH: Heres the lessons of history: When we  we pull back, voids are created. We left Iraq. We shouldve had a  a forces agreement to stay there with a small force, and instead of that, we politically and militarily pulled back, and now we have the creation of ISIS. 36 days ago in this very library, I gave a speech with a comprehensive strategy how to take out ISIS, and it requires American leadership and engagement. We dont have to be the worlds policemen. But we certainly have to be the worlds leader. We need to have  make sure that the world knows that were serious, that were engaged, that were not going to pull back, that  that our  that our word matters. And if we do that, we can create a force that will take out ISIS both in Iraq and in Syria, which will take a lot longer time now",TAPPER
" Thank you, Governor.",TAPPER
  because of what President Obamas done by pulling back.,BUSH
" Thank you, Governor. Senator Rubio?",TAPPER
" I want to go even deeper  and I want to go even deeper in that direction, because I think the belief that somehow by retreating, America makes the world safer has been disproven every single time its ever been tried. Syrias a perfect example of it. The uprising in Syria was not started by the United States; it was started by the Syrian people. And I warned at the time  this was three and a half years ago  I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists. Well, the president didnt listen, the administration didnt follow through, and thats exactly what happened. That is why ISIS grew. That is why ISIS then came over the border from Syria and back into Iraq. What is happening in that region is the direct consequence of the inability to lead and of disengagement. And the more we disengage, the more airplanes from Moscow youre going to see flying out of Damascus and out of Syria",RUBIO

" I havent had an opportunity to weigh in on foreign policy, and I just want to mention that when the war, when the issue occurred in 2003, I suggested to President Bush that he not go to war? OK. So I just want that on the record. And, you know, a lot of people are very much against us getting involved right now with global jihadism. And they refer back to our invasion of Iraq. And they seem to think that that was what caused it. What caused it was withdrawing from there and creating a vacuum which allowed this terrible situation to occur. But it is very different from what is going on today. Were talking about global jihadists who actually want to destroy us. They are an existential threat to our nation. And we have to be mature enough to recognize that our children will have no future if we put our heads in the sand. We have to recognize we have two choices. We either allow them the continue to progress and appear to be the winners, or we use every resource available to us to destroy",CARSON
" Thank you, Dr. Carson.",TAPPER
  them first.,CARSON
" I mean, it is interesting that you say that, because I want to ask Governor Christie about something else that you have said. Governor Christie, we just marked the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Now Dr. Carson has said that if he had been president at the time, the United States would not have gone to war in Afghanistan. What does that say to you about how Dr. Carson would respond as president if America were attacked again?",TAPPER
" Well, Jake, I was named U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001. And that next day my wife Mary Pat did what she did every day, she traveled through the World Trade Center and went to her office two blocks from the World Trade Center. And after those planes hit, for five-and-a-half-hours after that, I couldnt reach her, didnt know whether she was dead or alive, and we had three children at the time, 8, 5 and 1. And I had to confront what so many thousands of others in my region had to confront, the idea I might become a single parent, the idea that my life and my childrens life might be changed forever. We lost friends that day. We went to the funerals. And I will tell you that what those people wanted and what they deserved was for America to answer back against what had been done to them. And I support what President Bush did at that time, going into Afghanistan, hunting al Qaeda and its leaders, getting its sanctuary out of place, and making it as difficult around the world for them to move people and money. And then he went to prosecutors like us, and he said, never again. Dont prosecute these people after the crime is committed. Intervene before the crime happens. I absolutely believe that what the president did at the time was right. And I am proud to have been one of the people on the stage who was part of making sure that what Governor Bush said before was the truth. America was safe for those seven years and Barack Obama has taken that safety away from us.",CHRISTIE
 Dr. Carson?,TAPPER
" Well, recognize that, you know, President George W. Bush is a great friend of ours, and we spent many wonderful days at the White House. I havent been there in the last seven years. I probably have to have a food-tester. (LAUGHTER) But at any rate, I didnt suggest that nothing be done. What I suggested to President Bush is to be Kennedy-esque, in the sense that when the Russians got ahead of us in the space race, what we did is use the bully pulpit to galvanize everybody, business, industry, academia behind a national goal to put a man on the moon and bring him back safely. I said, you can do the same kind of thing. Declare that within five to 10 years we will become petroleum independent. The moderate Arab states would have been so concerned about that, they would have turned over Osama bin Laden and anybody else you wanted on a silver platter within two weeks. There are smart ways to do things and there are muscular ways to do things. And sometimes you have to look at both of those to come up with the right solution. (CROSSTALK)",CARSON
  Governor Christie.,TAPPER
" Let me say this, Jake, is that while that may have been a fine idea that Dr. Carson had, these people were out to kill us. I stood in that region with my family, and every time a plane went overhead in the weeks after that, peoples heads jerked to the sky because they thought it was happening again. You do not need to go through subtle diplomacy at that point. That could be handled later on. What you need is a strong American leader who will take the steps that are necessary to protect our nation. Thats what I would do as commander-in-chief in this circumstance. And thats what President George W. Bush did in 2001.",CHRISTIE
 Dr. Carson?,TAPPER
" I have no argument with having a strong leader, and to be aggressive where aggression is needed. But it is not needed in every circumstance. There is a time when you can use your intellect to come up with other ways to do things. And I think thats what we have to start thinking about.",CARSON
 There is no question that a lot of these problems that we have been talking about in terms of the international situation is because we are weak. It is because our Navy is so small. It is because our Air Force is incapable of doing the same things that it did a few years ago. Its because our Marines Corps is not ready to be deployed.,CARSON
" Thank you, Dr. Carson.",TAPPER
" There are a lot of problems that are going on, and we need to solve those problems, we need to build up our military",CARSON
" Thank you, Dr. Carson.",TAPPER
" But radical terrorism cannot be solved by intellect. It cannot  they require  what they need, is they need an operating space. Thats what Afghanistan was for Al Qaida. It was a vacuum that they filled, and they created an operating space. Thats why they had to be drawn out of there. Thats why they had to be destroyed. It is the reason why ISIS has grown as well. We allowed them  we allowed a vacuum to emerge in Syria. They used it as an operating space to grow; and today theyre not just in Iraq and Syria anymore, theyre now in Libya, conducting operations in the Sinai. Theyre now in Afghanistan, trying to supplant the Taliban as the most powerful radical jihadist group on the ground there, as well. You cannot allow radical jihadists to have an operating safe haven anywhere in the world.",RUBIO
" Thank you, Senator. Governor Huckabee.",TAPPER
" Just today  just today, there was a new report that 50 different intelligence analysts have said that what they sent up the ladder was doctored by senior officials, so that they could give some happy talk to the situation that we face. I love the idea of a good intellectual capacity to deal with our enemies, but the fact is, if you dont have good intelligence that is reliable and honest, you wont have good intelligence and you cannot make good decisions. The next president is primarily elected not just to know things, but to know what to do with the things that he knows. And the most dangerous person in any room is the person who doesnt know what he doesnt know.",HUCKABEE
